description: Studying the origins and transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) from flares and CMEs.

importance: 2
category: energetic
status: active

summary: >
  We quantify how flare reconnection, termination shocks, and CME-driven structures supply seed ions that become SEPs, then couple those spectra to large-scale transport models that predict what spacecraft actually see.

We regularly coordinate with mission teams (PSP, Solar Orbiter, GOES) to validate these models. Let me know if you need custom seed-population inputs or transport diagnostics for your analyses.
