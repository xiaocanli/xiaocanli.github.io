I am a staff scientist in T-2 at Los Alamos National Laboratory. My research focuses on particle acceleration and transport processes in space physics, solar physics, and high-energy astrophysics. I am particularly interested in magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence. My research primarily uses numerical simulations (particle-in-cell, MHD, and energetic-particle transport) and theoretical analysis (plasma dynamics and particle transport). I collaborate with the observation experts to explain the kinetic plasma phenomena in space plasmas and the origin of the energetic particles in solar flares and other explosive astrophysical events.
