I am a staff scientist in T-2 at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I study how magnetized plasmas convert stored energy into energetic particles. My work spans space and solar physics and astrophysical plasmas, but the thread running through all of it is particle acceleration and transport across multiple scales.

Most projects in my group blend large-scale particle-in-cell, hybrid, and MHD simulations with energetic-particle transport solvers. I enjoy building bridges between kinetic physics, reduced models, and observations—validating simulations against X-ray/radio data, translating reconnection dynamics into spacecraft signatures, and packaging tools others can reuse.

I collaborate closely with observers, laboratory experimentalists, and data scientists to interpret kinetic phenomena wherever they appear. If you are interested in multi-scale modeling, particle energization, or bringing new diagnostics to plasma simulations, please reach out.
